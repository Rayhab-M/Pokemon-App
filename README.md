## Task
Create a multiple-page Pokémon application using React.js with:  

- Lazy loading to load Pokémon dynamically.  
- Search functionality to filter Pokémon by name.  
- Routing for viewing Pokémon details without refreshing the page.  
- Error handling for failed API requests or no internet.  

## Description
This project fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI and displays them in a grid layout.  

- Users can scroll infinitely to load more Pokémon dynamically.  
- Clicking a Pokémon opens a detail page with stats and images.  
- The app uses React Router for seamless navigation.  
- Axios is used to fetch data from the API.
